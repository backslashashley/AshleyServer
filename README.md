# Ashley's Server!

My custom 1.12 server with my silly features.
A lot stolen from bis :)


## Feature List - Incomplete 


### Stackable Shulker Boxes
Executing the command `/stackboxes [stack size]` will stack all available boxes in your inventory. Maximum stack size is 16.

### AFK Player Statistics
There are two new statistics, stat.playOnMinuteNoAFK and stat.minutesAFK. Both of these track playtime without including afk time and afk time respectively. 

### Fixed Firework Usage Statistic
Using a firework with an Elytra will now increment the use firework statistic. 

### Hopper, Dropper, Dispenser Updates
Hoppers, droppers and dispensers will now send block state updates to the client.

### Camera Mode
Executing the command `/cam` will put the player into spectator and save their position and rotation. Executing the command again will put them back into survival and restore their position and rotation

### Total dig statistic
Combines pickaxe, axe, and shovel usage across all tool types into one unified dig statistic.
